This project references ideation workflow concepts from:

- Repository: `Orchestra-Research/AI-Research-SKILLs`

## Scope of reuse

Scholar-3 reuses high-level ideation patterns (e.g., structured divergence and convergence)
and adapts them to Scholar-3 artifact contracts:

- `research/idea.md`
- `research/idea.meta.yaml`
- `research/evidence-ledger.md`
- `research/proposals/Pxx-*/...`

No hard dependency on upstream files is required for runtime.

## Compliance note

When copying upstream text/code directly, keep upstream license and attribution notices.
When only reusing ideas/workflow structure, cite source repository and commit as above.
