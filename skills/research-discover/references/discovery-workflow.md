# Discovery Workflow (OPSX-style)

- Single global `research/idea.md` is the source of truth.
- Internal loop: Diverge (I1/I2/I3) -> Challenge (assumption/risk) -> Converge (H/F/C + protocol).
- Maintain stable IDs (H/F/C).
- Keep a proposal handoff capsule so `/proposal` can start without re-discovery.
- Freeze before running serious experiments.
- After freeze: changes must go through `research/idea-amendments/`.

This workflow is designed to be compatible with agentic coding tools:
- conversational exploration
- web-backed literature mapping
- strict falsification + protocol locking
- evidence planning before experiments
