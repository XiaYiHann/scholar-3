schema: scholar-research

context: |
  This workflow is for research projects.
  Source of truth (in the user's project):
    - research/idea.md (single global idea spec)
    - research/idea.meta.yaml (state: draft|frozen, version, counters)
    - research/evidence-ledger.md (Claim→Evidence→Pointer ledger)
  Phase execution units:
    - research/proposals/Pxx-*/ (each proposal is a phase package)

rules:
  idea:
    - Never fabricate citations. If not verifiable, mark UNVERIFIED.
    - Maintain stable IDs: H1/H2..., F1/F2..., C1/C2...
    - If idea is frozen, do not edit idea.md. Use idea-amendments.
  tasks:
    - Use checkbox format '- [ ] X.Y ...' exactly; otherwise progress tracking fails.
    - Each task must include command, expected outputs, and acceptance criteria.
  experiment_report:
    - No result statements without artifact pointers (logs/configs/figures/tables).
    - Report failures and negative results; no cherry-picking.
  manuscript:
    - Abstract/Contributions may only use VERIFIED claims from evidence-ledger.md.
